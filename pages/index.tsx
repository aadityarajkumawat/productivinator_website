                <p>
                    Productivitinator is a highly opinionated productivity app
                    which gives you the supreme access in the way you manage
                    yourself. I started this out pulling a gag on notion.so, but
                    now it makes sense to work on such a solution reaping off
                    the benefits of cloud syncing and non-blocking event-loop
                    driven architecture of nodejs.
